# # Application 

The main aim of this app is to mimic a camera shop allowing you to create, update and delete an order while also being able to list the products currently in stock on the database.



# Project Status

The project unfortunately had quite a few setbacks at the start, mainly figuring out how to properly link the database to the search bar to perform a READ function. The time spent trying to get this working before eventually settling for a simpler READ function means not everything works as I wanted and the testing wasn't effective either.

I believe with more time and practice these functions and the testing will be working 100% â€‹
